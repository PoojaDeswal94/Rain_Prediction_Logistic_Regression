# Rain Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Problem statement
This project is to answer the question that whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia using Logistic Regression with Python and Scikit-Learn.

To answer the question, I build a classifier to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia by training a binary classification model using Logistic Regression. I have used the Rain in Australia dataset downloaded from the Kaggle website for this project.

The Python implementation is presented in the Jupyter notebook

## Dataset description
I have used the Rain in Australia data set downloaded from the Kaggle website.

I have downloaded this data set from the Kaggle website. The data set can be found at the following url:-
